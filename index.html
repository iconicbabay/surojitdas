<h2><b>Hard Disk : </b> brief explanation</h2>
<p>A hard disk drive [HDD] is a non-volatile computer storage device containing magnetic disk or platters rotating at high speeds. it is a secondary storage device used to store data permanently, random access memory(RAM) being the primary memory device. Non-volatile means data is retained when the computer is turned off.A hard disk drive is also known as a hard drive.</p>

<h2><b>Defination of HDD :- </b></h2>
<p>A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage.</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>Types Of HDD</u><h2>

<p>Currently, I make a group of hard disk into Four Types ....</p>
<p>
1. Parallel Advance Technology Attachment (PATA) <br>
2. Serial Advance Technology Attachment (SATA) <br>
3. Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) <br>
4. Solid State Drives (SSD) <br>
</p>
<hr>
<p text align="center">
<h2>Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment </h2>
</p>

<p>The Parallel ATA interface standard to connect to computers. These types of drives are the ones we refer to as Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) and Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) drives.

<br>These PATA drives were introduced by Western Digital back in 1986. They provided a common drive interface technology for connecting hard drives and other devices to computers. Data transfer rate can go up to 133MB/s and a maximum of 2 devices can be connected to a drive channel. Most of the motherboards have a provision of two channels, thus a total of 4 EIDE devices can be connected internally.

<br>They make use of a 40 or 80 wire ribbon cable transferring multiple bits of data simultaneously in parallel. These drives store data by the use of magnetism. The internal structure is made of mechanical moving parts. They have been superseded by serial ATA.
</p>
<hr>
<p text align="center">
<h2>Serial ATA Storage Drives </h2>
</p>
<p>
These hard drives have replaced the PATA drives in desktop and laptop computers. The main physical difference between the two is the interface, although their method of connecting to a computer is the same. Here are some advantages of SATA Hard Disk Drives. Worth noting is that their capacities vary a lot and so does the prices. When buying a disk drive, you need to know its storage capacity and how much storage you want.
</p>
<p>
1. SATA drives can transfer data faster than PATA types by using serial signaling technology.<br >
2. SATA cables are thinner and more flexible than PATA cables. <br>
3. They have a 7-pin data connection, with cable limit of 1 meter. <br>
4. Disks do not share bandwidth because there is only one disk drive allowed per SATA controller chip on the computer motherboard.<br>
5. They consume less power. They only require 250 mV as opposed to 5V for PATA.<br>
6. Interface of SATA Drive <br>
7. A SATA Hard Disk Drive Pin Out <br>

<h2>Small Computer System Interface</h2>
</p>
<p>
These are quite similar to IDE hard drives but they make use of the Small Computer System Interface to connect to the computer. SCSI drives can be connected internally or externally. Devices that are connected in a SCSI have to be terminated at the end. Here are some of their advantages.
</p>
<p>
1. They are faster. <br>
2. They are very reliable. <br>
3. Good for 24/7 operations. <br>
4. Have a better scalability and flexibility in arrays. <br>
5. Well-adapted for storing and moving large amounts of data.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p text align="center">
<h2>Solid State Drives </h2>
</p>
<p>These are the latest in drive technology that we have in the computer industry. They are totally different from the other drives in that they do not consist of moving parts. They also do not store data using magnetism. Instead, they make use of flash memory technology. They make use of integrated circuits or semiconductor devices to store data permanently, at least until they are erased. Here are some of their advantages.</p>
<p>
1. Faster data access. <br>
2. Less susceptible to shock.<br>
3. Lower access times and latency. <br>
4. Durability. <br>
5. Less power usage <br>

<h3>Physical Components of a Hard Disk </h3>


<p>The main components of hard disk drive are: </p>
<p>
<u><b>Platters </b></u>:These are disk like structures present on the hard disk, stacked one above the other and store the data
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Head </u></b>:It is a device present on the arm of the hard drive that reads or writes data on the magnetic platters, mounted on the surface of the drive
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Spindle </b></u>: It is the spinning shaft on which holds the platters in a fixed position such that it is feasible for the read/write arms to get the data on the disks
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Actuator</b></u>: It is a device, consisting of the read-write head that moves over the hard disk con to save or retrieve information
</p>
<p>
<b><u>Cylinder </b></u>:These are the circular tracks present on the platters of the disk drive at equal distances from the center

<h2>Physical Structure of a Hard Disk </h2>
<p>
A hard disk contains a stack of platters, circular metal disks that are mounted inside the hard disk drive and coated with magnetic material, sealed in a metal case or unit. Fixed in a horizontal or vertical position, the hard disk has electromagnetic read or write heads above and below the platters. The surface of the disk consists of a number of concentric rings called as tracks; each of these tracks has smaller partitions called disk blocks. The size of each disk block is 512 bytes (0.5 KB). The track numbering starts with zero. When the platter rotates, the heads record data in tracks. A 3.5-inch hard disk can contain about thousand tracks.

<br>The spindle holds the platters in a fixed position such that it is feasible for the read/write arms to get the data on the disks. These platters rotate at a constant speed while the drive head, positioned close to the center of the disk, reads the data slowly from the surface of the disk compared to the outer edges of the disk. To maintain integrity of data, the head is reading at a particular period of time from any drive head position. The tracks at the outer edges of the disk have less densely populated sectors compared to the tracks close to the center of the disk.

<br>The disk fills the space based on a standard plan. One side of the first platter contains space, reserved for hardware track-positioning information which is not available to the operating system. The disk controller uses the track-positioning information to place the drive heads in the correct sector position.

<br>The hard disk records the data using the zoned bit recording technique, also known as multiple zone recording. This method combines the areas on the hard disk together as zones, depending on the distance from the center of the disk. A zone contains a certain number of sectors per track.
</p>
<h2>Logical Components of Hard Disk </h2>

<p>
A hard disk’s logical structure mainly depends on the file systems used and the software that defines the process of accessing data from the disk. Operating systems use different types of file systems, and those file systems use various other types of controlling and accessing mechanisms for data on the hard disk, Operating systems organize the same hard disk in many different ways.

<br>The logical structure of the hard disk directly influences the consistency, performance, compatibility, and expandability of the storage subsystems of the hard disk. The logical structure depends on the type of operating system and file system used, because these factors organize and control the data access on the hard disk.
</p>

<p>The most common computer file systems are: </p>

<h3>¹. FAT <br> ½. FAT32 <br>⅓. NTFS </h3>
